# Immersive 3D Visualization: Unveiling the Mystique of GPS and the Satellites that Power them

This repository holds scripts to pull gps and satellite data and store it in a datbabase for historical data and currently active device data. It also has an API for the cesiumjs frontend to create the 3D visualization with live satellite orbits and the gps current location. Many gps can be connected all over the world at the same time. You can see graphs in the frontend for device cpu temperatures and more.

## Goal
Our goal is to show what your gps is connected to behind-the-scenes and how satellite position can affect time accuracy. 

## Description
This is a semester long project for IE 421 - High Frequency Trading Technology instructed by Professor David Lariviere.
